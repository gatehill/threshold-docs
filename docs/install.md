Installation
============

See installation instructions for:

* [Kubernetes](kubernetes/tutorial.md)
* [Docker Compose](docker/docker-compose.md)
* [Docker](docker/docker.md)

If you've [purchased a license](https://www.threshold.cloud/pricing), you need to install it into your Threshold server.

If you just want to try out Threshold, see [these instructions](getting-started.md) for running a standalone Docker container.
