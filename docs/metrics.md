Metrics and monitoring
======================

Threshold helps you understand what your APIs are up to. It collects metrics on requests, responses, errors and timings. It alerts you when something doesn't look right. And since best practice applications should be observable, Threshold also provides great metrics about itself.

Plug into industry standard platforms with first class Prometheus support and CloudWatch metrics integration.

## Prometheus

You can view the Prometheus metrics on port 9136.

To access them, publish port 9136 in your `docker run` command.
